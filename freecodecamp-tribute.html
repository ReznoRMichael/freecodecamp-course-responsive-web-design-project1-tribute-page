            <p>In the light of the recent sad events, I wanted to make a small tribute - not only to the incredible beauty of this cathedral, but also to all the 3D artists who recreated this magnificent building in one of my favourite games in Assassin's Creed series.</p>
            
            <p>Ubisoft has not only donated 500,000â‚¬ to the cause of restoration of Notre Dame, but also <strong>gives away Assassin's Creed Unity for free</strong> until 25 April 2019 - this way everyone can admire how this great masterpiece looks like during the French Revolution in this incredibly detailed game.</p>
            
            <p>Assassin's Creed Unity was IMHO much ahead of its time and very underappreciated by the gamers community (due to few launch problems and design decisions, which are now changed and fixed). Now maybe more people will start to appreciate how much work was put into this game by the developers.</p>
            
            <p>Creating the whole Notre-Dame in the game took about 2 years to design. And it's not the only historic building fully recreated in this game. Remember: all players also get the DLC Dead Kings for free.</p>
